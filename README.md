###An Expense Tracker App
What this means is that this is just a dummy app that demontrates how the UI can look for a simple, light expense tracker app. 
###Some Important Info Before Using This App:
There are some example transactions already appearing on the screen under History section to demonstrate how transactions done previously would appear. Note that there is NO system in this repository that saves the transactions permenantly. All transactions' records will be deleted once the page is reloaded.
###How This App Works:
You can add a transaction either as an income, by pressing the Income button, or as an expense, by pressing the Expense button. In case you want to Delete a transaction, simply click on the transaction you want to delete appearing in History section.
