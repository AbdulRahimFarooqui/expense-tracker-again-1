##An Expense Tracker App
What this means is that this is just a dummy app <br />that demontrates how the UI can look for a simple,<br /> light expense tracker app. <br />
##Some Important Info Before Using This App:
There are some example transactions already <br />appearing on the screen under History section to
<br />demonstrate how transactions done previously<br />would appear. Note that there is NO system in <br />this repository that saves the transactions <br />permenantly. All transactions' records will be <br />deleted once the page is reloaded.<br />
##How This App Works:

<br />You can add a transaction either as an income, <br />by pressing the Income button, or as an <br />expense, by pressing the Expense button. In case you <br />want to Delete a transaction, simply click on <br />the transaction you want to delete appearing in <br />History section.
